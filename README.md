# Online-Shop
An online garden shop with three (3) products for sale, with each product having its own page. 

The deployed website can be view here --> plant-and-things.netlify.app, just copy and past the link into the browser to view the website.

There's a contact page where the contact details of the shop can be found should you wish to get in touch with the store for more details about each product, need more information that is not found on the website or need to get in touch with the store staff for other reasons.


# Intention of piece:
This is a personal project I made last year. 

It is an online shop that demonstrates responsive web design across multiple screen sizes.

The online shop main page image has been illustrated using Adobe illustrator, and
the website has been built using design principles of semantic HTML to make the content easy to read, and CSS for the responsive page design.
